## Recalculating_Flow_CCDFs

DWL Summer 2024 Mini-Project 1

The goal of this mini-project is to develop new, more-accurate guidelines for dam operators working along the Huron River.

### Overview

Dam operators are supposed to control releases of water to ensure that river flow does not change too dramatically in a short period of time. The maximum change in flow limit is determined by historical river flow measurements â€” but the current numbers are old!

This project is intended to recalculate the maximum flow limits by creating new **Complementary Cumulative Distribution Functions (CCDFs)** for river flow along the Huron River using more recent river flow data.
